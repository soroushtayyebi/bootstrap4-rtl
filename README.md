***Note: Hopefully, they will add rtl support to the next major release of bootstrap, so this project will be obsolete. However, it's going to be updated for the next 4.x releases.***

Bootstrap RTL provides simple yet robust right-to-left capability for Bootstrap 4, by employing new theming feature of it. Simply put its CSS after bootstrap's original CSS, to the pages designed by Bootstrap 4. It works just like an extension on top of the original Bootstrap:

```html
<!-- Original Bootstrap 4.x -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap.css">

<!-- Bootstrap RTL Theme -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap.rtl.css">
```
